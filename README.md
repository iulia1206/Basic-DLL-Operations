The homework took approximately 6 days.

TASK 1

- This task did not take very long
- I declared the structures and I created functions to initialize and to free a node,
  to initialize and destroy a list, to add and remove nodes
- I built the list in main.c
- The other functions are located in tema1.c and the declarations in tema1.h

TASK 2.1

- This task took a few hours.
- First, I copied the initial list.
- Then I have computed the mean and deviation, then tested if the value was in the specified range;
  if not, I eliminated that specific node from the new list
  
TASK 2.2.1

- This task took also a few hours.
- I created a new list in which I had put all the requested nodes with the right values.
- I took an auxiliary list in which I introduced the k=5 nodes sorted.
- I inserted the node at the position k/2 from the auxiliary list in the median nodes list, also 
  changing the timestamps accordingly 

TASK 2.2.2

 - The time of implementation was the same as the others
 - It is the same as TASK 2.2.1, but instead of the median node I calculated the mean of the k = 5 
   nodes. 

TASK 2.3

 - This took around half an hour
 - I just used the formula in the statement and I put them in a new list.

TASK 2.4

 - This took most of the time, because I did not understand the statement well
 - For each gap of minimum 1000, I started inserting nodes with timestamps incrementing by 200
 - For each number I introduced in the gap I computed c, w and the value to be inserted while keeping
the "neighbors"(left and right) the same.

TASK 2.5

 - This took a few hours
 - First, I calculated the range from the argument in the main function 
 - Then I calculated the start of the range set using the minimum value
 - While the range start did not surpass the maximum value I continued to increase it and I did not 
print the range unless there was at least one number in it.
